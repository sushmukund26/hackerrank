A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5] , then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].
Given an array of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format:
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of n (the number of integers) and d (the number of left rotations you must perform). The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

Output Format:
Print a single line of n space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing d left rotations.

Sample Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:
5 1 2 3 4

Explanation:
When we perform d=4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

	[1,2,3,4,5] -? [2,3,4,5,1] -> [3,4,5,1,2] -> [4,5,1,2,3] -> [5,1,2,3,4]

Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated values, which is 5 1 2 3 4.
