Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10^-4 are acceptable.

For example, given the array arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1] there are 5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios would be 2/5 = 0.400000, 2/5 = 0.400000 and 1/5 = 0.200000. It should be printed as

0.400000
0.400000
0.200000

Function Description:
Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below. It should print out the ratio of positive, negative and zero items in the array, each on a separate line rounded to six decimals.

plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of integers

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing an array of numbers arr(arr[0], arr[1],..,arr[n-1]).

Output Format:
You must print the following 3 lines:
A decimal representing of the fraction of positive numbers in the array compared to its size.
A decimal representing of the fraction of negative numbers in the array compared to its size.
A decimal representing of the fraction of zeros in the array compared to its size.

Sample Input:
6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1  

Sample Output:
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667

Explanation:
There are 3 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array.
The proportions of occurrence are positive: 3/6 = 0.500000, negative: 2/6 = 0.333333 and zeros: 1/6 = 0.166667.
