Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains n, the number of elements in the linked list.
The next n lines contain one element each, which are the elements of the linked list.

Output Format:
Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.

Sample Input:
2
16
13

Sample Output:
16
13

Explanation:
There are two elements in the linked list. They are represented as 16 -> 13 -> NULL. So, the printLinkedList function should print 16 and 13 each in a new line.
