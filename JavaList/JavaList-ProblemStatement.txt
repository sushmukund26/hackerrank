For this problem, we have 2 types of queries you can perform on a List:
1. Insert y at index x:
	Insert
	x y 
1. Delete the element at index x:
	Delete
	x 
Given a list, L, of N integers, perform Q queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, N (the initial number of elements in L). The second line contains N space-separated integers describing L. The third line contains an integer, Q (the number of queries). The 2Q subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:
* If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space separated integers x y, and the value y must be inserted into L at index x.
* If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index x, whose element must be deleted from L.

Output Format:
Print the updated list L as a single line of space-separated integers.

Sample Input:
5
12 0 1 78 12
2
Insert
5 23
Delete
0

Sample Output:
0 1 78 12 23

Explanation:
L = [12,0,1,78,12]
Q0 = Insert 23 at index 5. L0 = [12,0,1,78,12,23]
Q1 = Delete the element at index . L1 = [0,1,78,12, 23]
Having performed all Q queries, we print L1 as a single line of space-separated integers.
