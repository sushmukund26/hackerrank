The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. 
 Function Description:
Complete the getHeight or height function in the editor. It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.
getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):
* root: a reference to the root of a binary tree.
Note -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the tree. Next line contains n space separated integer where th integer denotes node[i].data.
Note: Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function. In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. All values on the right branch are greater than the node value. 
Output Format:
Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

Sample Input:
     3
    /   \
  2     5
 /        / \
1       4   6
                \
                 7

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
There are 4 nodes in the longest path that are connected by 3 edges, meaning our binary tree's  height = 3.
The longest path being: 3->5->6->7.
